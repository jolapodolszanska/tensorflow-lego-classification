# About the project

The project focuses on image classification using the MobileNetV2 deep neural network. It uses image processing and deep learning techniques to recognize and classify different classes of objects in images.

## Dataset
Lego Minifigures dataset contains a lot of pictures of various LEGO Minifigures. There are several images in different poses or with different environments for each Minifigure in the dataset. You can use this dataset for the image classification tasks or try to create more interesting things. You can try getting more accurate predictions for the test set. You can find this dataset at Kaggle.



## Features

Data Processing: Using the OpenCV library to load and process images, including resizing and color changes.

Data Augmentation: Using transformations from the Albumentations library to increase the variety of training data.

Modeling: Training the MobileNetV2 model with TensorFlow and Keras for image classification.

Model Validation: Using a validation and test set to evaluate model performance.
